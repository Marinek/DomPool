# MediaPool2-Server

MediaPool allows you to sort and share your blue ray, dvd or board games (etc.) with your friends. Track down the items you have loan to someone. You can have your own compilations of your board games that you want to buy and therefore you want to gather some additional notes.

MediaPool stores this information in a graph based database (neo4j) and (shall) allow comprehensive analysis of your media and board games.

Please note that this project is currently in the early beginnings. So there is not much to see at this moment. But have a look from time to time to see our progress.
